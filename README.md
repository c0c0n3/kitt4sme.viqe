KITT4SME VIQE
-------------
> Scrapping too many parts? Better call VIQE!

Deep learning image processing by Rovimatica to inspect and evaluate
the quality of manufacturing parts.


### Hacking

Install Python (`>= 3.8`), Poetry (`>=1.1`) and the usual Docker
stack (Engine `>= 20.10`, Compose `>= 2.1`). If you've got Nix, you
get a dev shell with the right Python and Poetry versions simply by
running

```console
$ nix shell github:c0c0n3/kitt4sme.viqe?dir=nix
```

Otherwise, install the usual way you do on your platform. Then clone
this repo, `cd` into its root dir and install the Python dependencies

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/c0c0n3/kitt4sme.viqe.git
$ cd kitt4sme.viqe
$ poetry install
```

Finally drop into a virtual env shell to hack away

```bash
$ poetry shell
$ charm .
# ^ Pycharm or whatever floats your boat
```

Run all the test suites:

```console
$ pytest tests
```

or just the unit tests

```console
$ pytest tests/unit
```

Measure global test coverage and generate an HTML report

```console
$ coverage run -m pytest -v tests
$ coverage html
```
